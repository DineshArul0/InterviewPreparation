    "question": "Explain how you would implement a comprehensive cross-browser compatibility testing framework.",
    "answer": "I would create: 1) A browser abstraction layer that normalizes differences in WebDriver implementations; 2) Browser-specific workaround libraries that activate automatically; 3) Feature detection rather than browser detection; 4) Capability-based test filtering to skip incompatible tests; 5) Visual comparison tools for layout verification across browsers; 6) Browser-specific wait strategies; 7) Detailed cross-browser compatibility reporting; 8) Responsive design testing across multiple viewports; 9) Historical browser version support through browser farms or virtual machines; 10) CSS and JavaScript polyfill injection for older browsers; 11) Browser performance benchmarking; 12) Browser-specific user agent handling. Implementation would use the factory pattern for creating browser-specific driver instances and strategy pattern for browser-specific behaviors, with a configuration system defining the browser matrix to test against."

    "question": "How would you automate testing of complex HTML5 Canvas applications?",
    "answer": "I would: 1) Use JavaScript execution to access the canvas context and state; 2) Implement canvas event simulation (mouse/touch interactions); 3) Capture and analyze canvas snapshots for verification; 4) Create custom assertions for canvas element states; 5) Interact with the application's internal model rather than the canvas when possible; 6) Use canvas accessibility hooks if available; 7) Implement pixel-by-pixel comparison with tolerance for rendering differences; 8) Create canvas action recordings and playback; 9) Leverage application-specific debugging hooks or state access; 10) Implement WebGL-specific testing for 3D canvas content; 11) Verify canvas animations through frame sampling; 12) Use computer vision techniques for interactive element detection.
